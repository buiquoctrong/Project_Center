					<p>Best Shopping Experience Once I declared myself to a good
						friend she decided that we needed a shopping day. First stop was
						to Victoria Secrets. She had me wander around the store to get
						comfortable and asked me to let her know if I had any
						reservations. The saleslady approached us and asked if we needed
						any assistance. After we told her we needed a few minutes, she
						said to call her if we needed anything. After about 5 minutes, I
						approached the saleslady and asked her if she could measure me for
						a bra. My friend was a bit shocked that I took the direct approach
						but I was getting very nervous and would have ran out of the store
						if I didn't get the right reaction. The saleslady smiled and took
						us to a back area of the store, measured me, put us in a changing
						room,and brought different bra styles to us. We spent about an
						hour trying on bras and when we were done I had selected two
						styles that I adored. We asked the saleslady if they came in
						certain colours and while she was checking I picked up a few
						panties. The lady at the register addressed me in my femme name
						and made all of the notations into their system under that name.
						By far the best shopping experience I have had and I am so very
						grateful to the ladies at VS and to my special friend.</p>
